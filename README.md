# HangmanGame-CodeAlpha-Project1
A simple and interactive console-based Hangman Game built using Python as part of my Python Development Internship at CodeAlpha.

📌 About The Project

This Hangman Game is my first internship project, assigned during my internship at CodeAlpha. The goal of this project was to strengthen programming fundamentals and apply problem-solving skills through practical development.
Hangman is a classic word guessing game where the player tries to discover a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time within limited attempts.
This project helped me gain hands-on experience with Python programming, logical thinking, and version control using Git & GitHub.

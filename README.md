# CodeAlpha_HangmanGame
A simple and interactive console-based Hangman Game built using Python as part of my Python Programming Internship at CodeAlpha.

📌 About The Project

This Hangman Game is my first internship project, assigned during my internship at CodeAlpha. The goal of this project was to strengthen programming fundamentals and apply problem-solving skills through practical development.
Hangman is a classic word guessing game where the player tries to discover a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time within limited attempts.
This project helped me gain hands-on experience with Python programming, logical thinking, and version control using Git & GitHub.

✨ Features:

🎯 Random word selection from predefined list

🔤 Letter-by-letter guessing

❤️ Limited lives system

✅ Correct & incorrect guess tracking

💻 Command-line interaction

🧠 Beginner-friendly logic

-> Programming Concepts Used:

Variables & Data Types

Conditional Statements (if-else)

Loops (for, while)

Lists & Strings

Functions

Random Module

User Input Handling

-> 🎮 How to Play:

The game selects a random word.

Guess one letter at a time.

Correct guesses reveal the word.

Wrong guesses reduce your lives.

Guess the word before lives run out to win!
